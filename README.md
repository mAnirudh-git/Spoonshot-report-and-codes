 Q1: Query and Document Matching
● I found the average no. of times the words related to a particular ingredient appeared.
● This will help us to find what are all the trending ingredients that are being used if the
article relates to that particular content.
● And the array that I got was:
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4,
4, 5, 5, 3, 3, 4, 0, 0]
● Conclusions:
If the article says good about vegan items, then I can conclude that they are trending.
However if it says bad about them, then they are not the trending ones.
Q2: How you code and solve problems
The relation that I found in input and output is:
● Output is of the same size as that of the input.
● When the product in terms of array is non zero, the element of output is product divided
by the corresponding index element of input.
● When the product of is zero, the output is an array with zeros corresponding to the index
of non zero element in input and product of non zero elements of input when
corresponding index element of input is zero.
● I also attached my code.
